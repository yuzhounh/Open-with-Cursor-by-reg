# Open with Cursor - Context Menu Integration

This project adds Cursor editor options to the Windows context menu for files, folders, and folder backgrounds by modifying the Windows registry.

## Features

- Adds "Open with Cursor" option to the context menu for files, folders, and folder backgrounds
- Adds "通过 Cursor 打开" option for Chinese language users
- No administrator privileges required
- User-specific installation (affects only current user)
- Works on work laptops and corporate environments

## Usage

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

1. **Modify Configuration**: Open the `.reg` file you want to use and replace all `<YourUsername>` with your Windows username
2. **English**: Double-click the modified `install-open-with-cursor.reg`
3. **Chinese**: Double-click the modified `install-open-with-cursor-zh.reg`
4. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for confirmation
5. Restart File Explorer or log out and back in

### Uninstallation

1. Double-click `uninstall-open-with-cursor.reg`
2. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for confirmation
3. Restart File Explorer or log out and back in

**Note:** The registry files use `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` instead of `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`, making the installation user-specific and eliminating the need for administrator privileges.
